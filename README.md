# Design Challenge: Spring '19

Welcome to the Penn Labs Spring '19 Design Challenge!

## Introduction

---

We want you to take a look at Penn Course Search, a product acquired by Penn Labs. We are adding it to our Penn Course suite along with Penn Course Review and Penn Course Alert. On Penn Course Search, students can filter and search for courses, view simplified ratings, and create mock schedules. 

Treat this assignment as if you're a designer working with product managers and developers. Your deliverable will have to communicate core functionality of the product to PMs, and design components to developers. 

## **What are we assessing?**

---

This project will help us understand your design thinking as well as your familiarity with tactical execution, which is crucial for designing products with cross-functional teams. 

1. **Product**: do you understand the end user, their specific use cases, and how the product will address their needs? What existing resources meet the user's needs and what gaps exist? Consider which features make sense to add. Do not add things that seem ‚Äúcool‚Äù but don‚Äôt address the problem.
2. **Intuition**: is the design focused, simple, and intuitive? Does it complement the existing Penn Labs brand?
3. **Execution**: are the mockups/prototypes thorough, easy to understand, and ready to be passed on to a developer? Note that pixel-perfect design is not a criteria - we want to see how you represent your design thinking in a visual form.

## Context

---

Let's be real: how painful is making mock schedules on Penn InTouch while toggling between your academic planning worksheet, course listings on multiple departmental websites, and any other planning documents you made yourself?

Registration is a complex process where students have to think about major requirements, course/professor ratings, and course offerings. All this data comes from a variety of different sources and is not leveraged to create any easy-to-use tools. Students would benefit from features such as comprehensive search filtering, integrated ratings, and a sleek mock scheduler.

To this end, Labs recently acquired Penn Course Search (the name is not set in stone). As it currently exists, it offers certain search filters and a mock scheduler that's optimized for 1 semester. We want to clean it up and integrate it into our Penn Course suite, which already includes Penn Course Review and Penn Course Alert.

# Deliverables

---

Think about all the information students need when they go through the registration process. (Re)design a website to help them do this more efficiently. Market this product to increase user adoption.

Your deliverables:

- High fidelity mockup and/or prototype of the web app
    - This can be presented in whatever way you choose. Mockups can just be images, or compiled on a document with accompanying comments. Or a prototype link on Invision. Or a Github repo. Really, as long as I can view your work, any format is acceptable.
- Content for Facebook post and graphic, marketing the product or a specific feature. See FAQ for an example.

You are **highly encouraged** to provide written aids explaining your design (features, process, etc.) - anything that will help us understand you better as a designer!

Finally, here are a few things we want you to remember when designing:

- What information and functions are integral (that address specific pain points of Penn students!)
- How the user will *interact* with the application before you consider ~ aesthetics ~
- Edge cases regarding data or users, and how to account for them
- This is a complex application, so be wary of getting bogged down in the specifics - ie. instead of looking up and writing out the *exact* College requirements, just put placeholders.
- **Don't get overwhelmed!** We want to see how you approach a design problem, think through it, and represent that in a mockup/prototype. We do not expect a perfect, 100% complete app design!

# *Suggested* tools

---

Sketch, Adobe Suite, InVision, Figma, HTML/CSS. But really, you're free to use whatever you're most comfortable with! 

[Penn Labs style guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1auGLpo7P1IidLidB3erCN-XxDAh75Ko_/view). 

[Bulma, the CSS framework we use for products.](https://bulma.io/documentation/) Feel free to reference this for the basic components that we use. Do not feel obligated to use follow it exactly, it's just a reference!

# Submission

---

Congratulations - you've completed the design challenge üéâ

By **8 am on Monday 2/11,** email your deliverable to **contact@pennlabs.org** with the subject line: "DESIGN APPLICATION: *YOUR_NAME_HERE".* If your file is big, 

# Frequently Asked Questions

---

- **I have a clarification question / lot of other questions / need help.**

    Attend the Office Hours from 1-3pm on Saturday 2/9 @ Steinberg Dietrich 209. We will be there to answer any questions about the challenge and how to approach it.

    Always feel free to reach out by emailing me (Valencia) at vfu@sas.upenn.edu. I will get back to you as soon as possible all weekend :)

- **What's the "Facebook post and graphic" deliverable?**

    Peep the Penn Labs Facebook page and you'll see our posts about new products/features. Deliver something along those lines, about the product you designed. Here's an example - it's short and sweet:

    ![](Untitled-3f208dcb-7cd7-4b77-9325-fbf25011f690.png)

- **What's after this round?**

    This is the last round! You may get an email asking you to clarify your decisions or explain your design, but otherwise you will be updated with final decisions in the following week.

- **This is so much work for a weekend. What are you really expecting?**

    As mentioned previously, we want to see your design approach and mockup/prototype skills. Not a perfect product design!

    We definitely want you to give this challenge your all, but don't want you work for 48 hours nonstop. Hopefully a weekend is ample time to work thoughtfully, and even revisit your design a couple times, before finally submitting.
